## Phase 3 — Architecture (Week 5–8)

| ID | Task | Status | PR | Notes |
|----|------|--------|----|----|
| 3.1 | Define repository interfaces | ⬜ Not started | - | Pure types, no implementation |

| 3.3 | Extract `CreditService` | ⬜ Not started | - | Move logic out of routes |
| 3.4 | Extract `BookingService` | ⬜ Not started | - | Orchestrates 4+ external systems |
| 3.5 | Extract `PaymentService` | ⬜ Not started | - | Webhook processing lives here |
| 3.6 | Extract `SessionService` | ⬜ Not started | - | Zoom lifecycle management |
| 3.7 | Reorganize folder structure | ⬜ Not started | - | Move files into domain/services/infrastructure |

**Exit criteria:** Route handlers contain no business logic, services are unit-testable without HTTP mocking, all existing behavior preserved.

|----|------|--------|----|----|
| 4.1 | Supabase setup + schema migration | ⬜ Not started | - | Use SQL from PLAN.md §4 |
